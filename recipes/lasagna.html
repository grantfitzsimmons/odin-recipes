            Lasagna is a popular Italian dish that is beloved for its comforting and hearty nature. Layer upon layer of
            flat pasta sheets intermingled with rich tomato sauce, flavorful meat (usually ground beef or sausage), and
            a creamy, indulgent cheese mixture make lasagna a true gastronomic delight.

            It is often seasoned with aromatic herbs like oregano and basil, which further enhance its savory taste.
            Baked to perfection, the lasagna emerges from the oven with a golden, crispy top and a melange of flavors
            that meld together beautifully. Whether enjoyed as a family meal or served at gatherings, lasagna offers a
            satisfying and mouthwatering experience that captures the essence of Italian cuisine.

        <h2>How Long to Cook Lasagna</h2>
        <p>The assembled lasagna should take about 50 minutes to cook in an oven preheated to 375 degrees F. Cover it
            with foil for the first 25 minutes, then let it cook uncovered for the final 25 minutes. Also, it's
            important to let the lasagna rest at room temperature for about 15 minutes before you cut into it.</p>
